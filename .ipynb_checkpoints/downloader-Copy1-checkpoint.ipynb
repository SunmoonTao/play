They attacked Mr. Akerman\\'s house precisely at seven o\\'clock; they were preceded by a man better dressed than the rest, who went up to Mr. Akerman\\'s door; he rapped three times, and I believe pulled the bell as often. Mr. Akerman had barrocadoed his house. When the man found that no one came, he went down the steps, made his obeisance to the mob, and pointed to the door, and then retired.</p>               <p>Have you any recollection how that man who you say had a better appearance than the rest was dressed? - I think he had on a dark brown coat and a round ha, but I cannot be particular as to that; the mob immediately following in that formidable manner made such an impression upon me, that I did not take notice. The mob approached about thirty in number, three a-breast, some with paving mattocks, others with iron crows and chissels; and then followed an innumerable company with bludgeons; they seemed to be the spokes of coach-wheels; they divided, some went to Mr. Akerman\\'s door with the mattocks, some to the felons door, and some to the debtor\\'s door. I was struck with the formidable appearance and order in which they divided and proceeded to destroy the place, the men threw their sticks up at the windows, which they broke and demolished, yet notwith standing these sticks were coming down in showers, two men with a bar, such as brewers servants carry on their shoulders,<div class=\"facsimile-link-wrapper\"><div class=\"facsimile-link\"><span class=\"facsimile-text\"><a href=\"images.jsp?doc=178006280087\">See original</a></span><span class=\"facsimile-image\"><a href=\"images.jsp?doc=178006280087\"><img class=\"facsimile-image-img\" src=\"i/genericThumb.jpg\" alt=\"Click to see original\"/></a></span></div></div> attacked the parlour window to force it open. The window-shutters were exceedingly tough; they at last forced them partly open, but not quite. I then saw a man in a sailor\\'s jacket helped up, he forced himself neck and heels into the window. They found the house-door still difficult to get open; before it was got open the other parlour window was opened and the mob were throwing the goods out at the window; at last the house-door gave way; about the same time some of the goods and furniture having been thrown out into the street, a fire was kindled.</p>               <p>They proceeded immediately to throw the goods out of the house? - Immediately. An equal degree of activity seemed to exhibit itself on the outside as within, one party to burn, the other to throw out the goods of Mr. Akerman. When the conflagration took place I applied my mind to the mob.</p>               <p>Was Mr. Akerman\\'s house on fire then? - No. I was situated in the one-pair-of-stairs room, and could see what happened. I endeavoured to form a distinction between the active and inactive people. I thought I did so; the inactive people seemed to form a circle. I observed a person better dressed than the rest among those within the circle, who did not meddle, but seemed to be exciting and encouraging others. I saw several genteel looking men, and amongst them a black; there was one genteel man in particular, whose conduct I confess excited my indignation, and I took particular notice of him. I went down amongst the mob; I spoke to him; I made myself master of his voice; I believe if I was out of his sight I could swear to his voice; I have never seen that man since. When I first saw the black I turned to a lady and said, this is a motley crew, and of every colour. Mr. Akerman\\'s house had then catched fire; the house in which I was was in extreme danger; my self with some others went down to desire the mob to prevent the houses of innocent people catching fire; and the mob were as active in saving those as in destroying Mr. Akerman\\'s. I had no opportunity of making any remarks till I went to my station again, then I believe it was near nine o\\'clock; I heard a cry and a gingling of keys in the hands of some person; there were three or four genteel persons, but who had the keys I cannot say. Amongst them was the prisoner at the bar; he was without his hat, and his hands were down. I thought he might have his hat in his hand. The house I think was at that time destroyed; the roof was fallen in. Then those persons of the genteeler description moved off towards Smithfield, and amongst them was the prisoner.</p>               <p>You had observed the black in the mob before you went down? - I had.</p>               <p>Are you able to say who that black was? - No. Seeing this man afterwards I took it for granted it was him; I was certain to him the second time; he had his hat off in the middle of the mob.</p>               <p>Jury. You said his hands were down, did you see any thing in his hands? - No, I did not; I took it for granted he had his hat in his hand, not having it on his head.</p>               <p>Cross Examination.</p>               <p>There were I believe other blacks in the mob? - I never saw but one; I saw a black at first, but did not remark him so as to swear to him.</p>               <p>You could not swear to him I suppose from the difficulty every man has in his mind to swear to any black? - Yes.</p>               <p>There is more difficulty to swear to a black than to a white man? - No. The second time I made my remark too judiciously to err.</p>               <p>When was it you first saw the black? - After the goods were first set on fire, which was about a quarter after seven o\\'clock.</p>               <p>What dress had the black on? - Something of a dark colour, but my remark was on his face.</p>               <p>What w as remarkable in that man\\'s face more than another black? - The make of his hair was one thing; the curls were out if he had had any; and his hair smooth on his head. His face was so exposed to my view the second time, that I could not be better situated to make any remark on his face.</p>               <p>                  <div class=\"facsimile-link-wrapper\"><div class=\"facsimile-link\"><span class=\"facsimile-text\"><a href=\"images.jsp?doc=178006280088\">See original</a></span><span class=\"facsimile-image\"><a href=\"images.jsp?doc=178006280088\"><img class=\"facsimile-image-img\" src=\"i/genericThumb.jpg\" alt=\"Click to see original\"/></a></span></div></div>His hair was the thing by which you knew him? - His hair and his face.</p>               <p>What was particular in his face? - I cannot distinguish it any other than from the weight of the impression it made on me.</p>               <p>Counsel for the Crown.

It was a little after seven o\\'clock; I saw him in Mr. Akerman\\'s two-pair-of-stairs room, he stood against the window with something in his hand and looked at me for some time before I observed particularly what he was doing. I looked at him then, and he took up something off the ground and held it up to me; when he held it up, I went down from the window into the dining-room; I came up again, and he was there still. He seemed to be looking in a drawer upon the floor, and seemed to be doing some thing up into a bundle.</p>               <p>You was in the two-pair-of-stairs room opposite him? - No, I was in the three-pair-of-stairs room.</p>               <p>Did you afterwards see him do any thing else? - He got up and looked at me and nodded his head at me; then I went down stairs.</p>               <p>You saw him again in the course of the evening? - Yes, I saw him an hour or two afterwards in the mob.</p>               <p>From the observation you made of his person are you sure that is the man? - That is the man.</p>               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No, none at all.</p>               <p>Cross Examination.</p>               <p>What makes you so positive that this is the man? - I know his face perfectly again by his standing and looking at me so long.</p>               <p>You recollect him only by his face? - His face and his hair.</p>               <p>Did you see any other black there? - Yes, I did; not in the house but in the mob.</p>               <p>Could you swear to him? - I do not know that I could. I took more notice of this man than I did of any other.</p>               <p>Court.

My Lord, please to ask that woman if she did not wash the handkerchief the things were tied up in? - I washed a blue-and-white silk handkerchief, I cannot swear it was this, it was all over mud. I washed it on the Thursday, the first week that I was in the house.</p>               <p>Was that after the burning of Newgate? - Yes.
